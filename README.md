# LeakyBucket [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jeroenvisser101/LeakyBucket.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jeroenvisser101/LeakyBucket)
Leaky Bucket is an algorithm which works as follows:

1. There is a bucket.
1. The bucket has a defined leak and defined capacity.
1. The bucket leaks at a constant rate.
1. Overflows when full, will not add other drops to the bucket.

## Usage

### Basic usage
``` php
<?php

use LeakyBucket\LeakyBucket;
use LeakyBucket\Storage\RedisStorage;

// Define which storage to use
$storage = new RedisStorage();

// Define the bucket
$settings = [
    'capacity' => 10,
    'leak'     => 1
];

// Create the bucket
$bucket = new LeakyBucket('example-bucket', $storage, $settings);

// Fill the bucket
$bucket->fill();

// Check if it's full
if ($bucket->isFull()) {
    header('HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests');
    exit '<!doctype html><html><body><h1>429 Too Many Requests</h1><p>You seem to be doing a lot of requests. You\'re now cooling down.</p></body></html>';
}

// ...
```

### Other functionality
You can also do great stuff with it through the methods that LeakyBucket provides.

``` php
// Get capacity information
$capacityTotal = $bucket->getCapacity();
$capacityLeft  = $bucket->getCapacityLeft();
$capacityUsed  = $bucket->getCapacityUsed();

// Get the drops/second that the bucket leaks
$leakPerSecond = $bucket->getLeak();

// Get the last timestamp from when the bucket was updated
$timestamp = $bucket->getLastTimestamp();

// Set additional data
$bucket->setData(
    [
        'timeout' => 3600
    ]
);

// Get additional data
$data = $bucket->getData();

// Update the bucket with the leaked drops
$bucket->leak();

// Remove excess drops
$bucket->overflow();

// Update the bucket's timestamp manually
$bucket->touch();

// Fill the bucket with one drop
$bucket->fill();

// Fill the bucket with 5 drops
$bucket->fill(5);

// Spill one drop from the bucket
$bucket->spill();

// Spill 5 drops from the bucket
$bucket->spill(5);

// Remove the bucket's content
$bucket->reset();

// Force save
$bucket->save();
```
